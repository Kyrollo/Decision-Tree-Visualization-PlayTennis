# Decision Tree Visualization with PlayTennis Dataset

This repository contains Python scripts for building and visualizing a decision tree using the PlayTennis dataset. The script includes data preprocessing, decision tree construction, and visualization using Graphviz.

## Description

The project demonstrates the construction of a decision tree from the PlayTennis dataset. It includes functions to calculate entropy, average entropy, and information gain. The decision tree is built recursively and visualized using Graphviz.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Reads and preprocesses the PlayTennis dataset.
  - Encodes categorical labels.
- **Decision Tree Construction**:
  - Calculates entropy and information gain to determine the best split.
  - Builds the decision tree recursively.
- **Visualization**:
  - Visualizes the constructed decision tree using Graphviz.

## Usage

To use these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Decision-Tree-Visualization-PlayTennis.git
